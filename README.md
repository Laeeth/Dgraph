Dgraph
======

Dgraph is a library for creating, analysing and manipulating graphs, written in
the D programming language.  It aims to be fast and memory-efficient while also
being easy to use and extend.

The project is in very early experimental stages of development, so breaking
changes may occur on a regular basis (although every effort will be made to
ensure that such breakage is justified by the gains).  News and updates on
the project will be published on the author's blog: http://braingam.es/
